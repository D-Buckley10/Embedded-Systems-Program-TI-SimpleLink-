# CS-350-Portfolio

*Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.*

I chose to upload three of my projects that I completed throughout this semester since I feel that there wasn't just one particular project I excelled in (or lack thereof). The first project that I worked on was the pwmled2 project. The puspose of this assignment was to understand working with a Pulse Width Modulator in order to set the period time for a blinked LED light.

The second project would be the UART2Echo project. This project allowed me understand how to reach characters from the UART while also using a GPIO to be able to control the period at which the LED's woould flash. Furthermore the third project involved working with the two buttons associated with deifferent GPIO stacks to be able to create alternating morse code messages "OK" and "SOS". 

*What did you do particularly well?*

I believe that my understanding of the conceopts and providing clear explaination of my work through documentation was where I did particularly well in these projects. Since I have some experience working with C++, coding embedded machines in C was rather easy to pick up on for me.

*Where could you improve?*

While I may have some confidence in my understanding on conceopts and implementing them, one thing I struggled with this semester was being able to debug my code properly. I was greeted with tons of different errors when attempting to debug my programs and actually examine how my code would impact my board. However each error seemed to be a different variation of "invalid communication between board and IDE". I found this to be a little frustrating since in order to build the projects in CCS, the board has to be connected and able to communicated with one another. 

*What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?*



*What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?*



*How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?*
